------------------------------------------------------------------------

All simulator configurations can be changed in the init scripts found in
the folder Init_scripts. Further explanation is given in the respective
files.


Running the simulator:

1. Run initialization.m
2. Run main.m

If the dynamical properties of the snake are changed, initialization.m
has to be re-run. Else it is sufficient to re-run the modified script.

simulator, see the project report.
